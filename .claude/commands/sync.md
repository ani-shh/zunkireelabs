Execute this sequence to become project-aware:

### 1. Load Project Context
Read these files in order:
- `.brain/project-context.md` - Project overview, tech stack, goals
- `.brain/status-current.md` - Current sprint, blockers, recent work
- `.brain/user-profile.md` - Sadin's preferences for this project

### 2. Load Project Patterns
- `.brain/workflow-patterns.md` - Project-specific patterns
- `.brain/decisions-log.md` - Key decisions and reasoning

### 3. Check Parent Brain Link
- `.brain/parent-link.json` - Connection to Global Sadin-Stark

### 4. Check Latest Session (if exists)
- Latest file in `.brain/session-logs/` directory
