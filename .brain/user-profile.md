## Core Patterns (From Global Profile)

### Communication Style
- **Visual-First:** Screenshots with markers (purple highlights, rulers)
- **Direct & Concise:** No fluff, action-oriented
- **Confirmation:** "you got me?" before major changes
- **Brief Approvals:** "yes", "go ahead" when ready to proceed

### Decision-Making
- **Speed:** Fast decisions with room to adjust
- **Evidence-Based:** Try → See → Decide (not plan endlessly)
- **Pragmatic:** Working solution > perfect solution

### Execution Patterns
- **Fast Iteration:** Minutes, not hours for cycles
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Basic → Test → Polish
- **Test Before Deploy:** Always dev before prod
